        - A planning analytic journal object is created. It is similar to the analytic journal, but used for planning purposes
        - The planning analytic journals can be configured
        - A planning analytic journal lines object is created, with the exceptions of referencing 
        to the planning analytic journal instead of the analytic journal, and considering 
        that the general account is not a required entry.
        - The new object is visible as a separate entity, accesible from the Accounting area, with the corresponding search, tree, form views.
        - New analytic account attributes: cumulated planned costs, cummulated planned earnings and cumulated balance.
        The attributes are calculated based on the planning analytic journal lines. 
        The new attributes are visible on the following views:
            − Analytic account forms: cumulated planned costs, cumulated planned earnings and cumulated balance
            − Budget positions: cumulated planned costs
